        <p>Hey there, I'm Emily! Currently living in Durham, North Carolina, I spend my time between work, school, and home. I am a private music teacher, mainly focusing on Violin, Viola, and Piano, as well as a section Violinist in the Durham Symphony. When I am not teaching or performing, I am studying and learning. Right now, not only am I attending the UNC Coding Bootcamp, I am also working on a dual Associates Degree in Science and Engineering, with plans to transfer to UNC-Chapel Hill to complete my education. For as long as I can remember, music as been my life, so the process of making a career change at twenty-seven has been stressful (because I am still unsure of what I want my future career to be) but also extremely rewarding. My husband, Luke, a Systems Engineer at Tivo, and my father, Larry, a Consultant and IT App Developer at Nationwide Financial, had both planted the idea of possibly going into IT, so when I found the Coding Bootcamp online I knew it was the perfect opportunity to get some hands-on experience while working on a degree. </p>
